In this paper we present a method for computing one-dimensional convolutions by polynomial transforms. We show that this method is computationally efficient, even for large convolutions, and can be implemented with FFT-type algorithms, while avoiding the use of trigonometric functions and complex arithmetic. We then extend this technique to complex convolutions and to multidimensional convolutions.</abstract><urls><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel6/29/26145/01163372.pdf</url><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1163372</url><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1163372</url></urls><references><ref><id>c4b01463-b37a-494a-adf1-3306b709313b</id></ref><ref><id>c4b01463-b37a-494a-adf1-3306b709313b</id></ref></references></article>
