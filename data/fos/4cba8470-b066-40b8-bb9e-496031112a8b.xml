Point Cloud is acquired fast and of high accuracy with tie-control points that set in different blocks. Feature points are extracted from scan data and compared with its reference points designed to analyze its variation of position and size, which has active guidance meaning for engineering construction. Finally three applications are given to prove the effectiveness of the method proposed.</abstract><urls><url>http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XXXIX-B3/173/2012/isprsarchives-XXXIX-B3-173-2012-metrics.html</url><url>http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XXXIX-B3/173/2012/isprsarchives-XXXIX-B3-173-2012.html</url><url>http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XXXIX-B3/173/2012/isprsarchives-XXXIX-B3-173-2012.pdf</url><url>http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XXXIX-B3/173/2012/</url><url>http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XXXIX-B3/173/2012/isprsarchives-XXXIX-B3-173-2012-relations.html</url></urls><references /></article>
