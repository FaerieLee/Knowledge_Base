The effects are essentially linked to improved metabolic performance of muscles and reduced endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance and neurohormonal abnormalities. Training also has an impact on the evolution of major risk factors, especially diabetes and arterial hypertension. The risks are limited as long as the contraindications are respected and the programmes supervised. The indications (stable angina, chronic heart failure, peripheral arterial disease) should be described more precisely by taking into account functional criteria: physical deconditioning, exclusion, compliance, mood swings, and seriousness of risk factors. The training programme should be tailor made and based on evaluation of the patient's adaptation to effort, in terms of frequency, intensity and duration of the exercises. Various types of exercise include overall or segmental physical training; concentric, eccentric, even isokinetic muscle contraction exercises; and proprioceptive rehabilitation. However, knowledge is lacking about the molecular mechanisms of the effects of training, the most effective intensity of effort, and strategies to develop physical activity in this ever-growing population for both primary and secondary prevention."}

Starting from the key intermediate 4 , Boc-protected ( R )-5,5,5-trifluoronorvaline and ( S )-5,5,5-trifluoronorvaline were concisely synthesized over three steps in 62% and 63% yield, respectively. Keywords Fluorinated amino acids 3,3,3-Trifluoropropynyllithium 5,5,5-Trifluoronorvaline 1 Introduction In recent years, incorporation of trifluoromethyl-containing amino acids (TFAAs) into peptides and proteins has become an important tool in the design of peptides and proteins [1\u20137] . The importance of TFAAs made the development of new and efficient enantioselective methodologies or strategies to their synthesis a significant and active area of research [8\u201311] . Among these trifluoromethylated amino acids, 5,5,5-trifluoronorvaline had attracted attention earlier. In 1955, Loncrini and co-workers described that 5,5,5-trifluoronorvaline could inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and may be used as a growth regulatory factor in microbiology [12] . Ojima et al. reported in 1992 that the new methonine\u2013enkephalin analogs bearing ( d )-trifluoronorvaline in place of one glycine exhibited ca. 100,000 times enhancement in in vivo analgesic activity in comparison with methionine\u2013enkephalin [13] . Therefore, several synthetic routes to 5,5,5-trifluoronorvaline were developed. In most cases racemic mixtures of 5,5,5-trifluoronorvaline were obtained [14\u201320] . To the best of our knowledge, there was only one report about the stereoselective synthesis of 5,5,5-trifluoronorvaline, in which the fluorinated reagent SF 4 was used [19] . Therefore, the development of efficient and stereoselective route to 5,5,5-trifluoronorvaline was anticipated. Herein we report a concise synthesis of both enantiomers of trifluoronorvaline using nucleophilic addition of 3,3,3-trifluoropropynyllithium to d -glyceraldimine 2 as the key step. 2 Results and discussion In general, the additions of Grigard reagents or organolithium reagents to imine were found to be rather complicated. However, the additions of Grigard reagents or organolithium reagents to d -glyceraldimine proceeded very well [21] , which were attributed to prior formation of a five-membered chelate with the 2-alkoxy group [21\u201325] . Using this kind of addition reactions, Cativiela et al. [26\u201328] successfully prepared a number of important unnatural amino acids. Thus, we proposed that the additions of fluoroalkyl substituted organometallic reagents to glyceraldimine should present an efficient synthetic strategy for fluorinated amino acids ( Scheme 1 ) [29] . Tarrant and co-workers described that the addition of 3,3,3-trifluoroisopropenyllithium, in situ generated from the reaction of 2-bromo-3,3,3-trifluoro-1-propene and n -butyl lithium at low temperature, to carbonyl compounds gave trifluoromethylated alcohols in moderate yields [30] . Recently, Ichikawa re-examined the reaction of 2-bromo-3,3,3-trifluoro-1-propene with butyl lithium and succeeded in efficiently trapping highly unstable 3,3,3-trifluoroisopropenyllithium by strained cyclic ethers [31] . We were interested in extending Tarrant's reaction to glyceraldimine. Initially treatment of d -glyceraldimine 2 with in sit u generated 3,3,3-trifluoroisopropenyllithium in Et 2 O at \u221295 \u00b0C was complicated and the desired allylic amine 3 was not obtained ( Scheme 2 ). When THF was used as solvent instead of Et 2 O, the trifluoromethylated propargylic amine 4 ( syn / anti = 1: 2.5) was isolated in 13% yield. In our opinion, the formation of trifluoromethylated propargylic amine 4 resulted from the addition of in situ generated trifluoropropynyllithium to d -glyceraldimine 2 [32] . The generation of trifluoropropynyllithium indicated 2-bromo-3,3,3-trifluoro-1-propene upon treatment with n BuLi in THF underwent partly a dehydrobromination reaction to form 3,3,3-trifluoropropynyl anion, although the lithium\u2013bromine exchange followed by lithium fluoride elimination was major pathway of the reaction of 2-bromo-3,3,3-trifluoro-1-propene with n BuLi [30,31] . This result promoted us to further study the reaction between 3,3,3-trifluoropropynyllithium and d -glyceraldimine for improving the yield of compound 4 , because propargylic amine 4 is a potential precursor for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated amino acids. Yamazaki et al. reported that the convenient generation of 3,3,3-trifluoropropynyl anion was realized from 2-bromo-3,3,3-trifluoro-1-propene in the presence of less nucleophilic LDA [32] . Accordingly, the addition of 3,3,3-trifluoropropynyllithium, in situ generated from the reaction of 2-bromo-3,3,3-trifluoro-1-propene with 2.0 equiv. of LDA in THF at \u221278 \u00b0C, to d -glyceraldimine 2 was carried out ( Scheme 2 ). We were pleased to find that the reaction proceeded smoothly and the isolated yield of trifluoromethylated propargylic amine 4 was increased to 55%. The ratio of two diastereomers of compound 4 was 1:1.5. The two diastereomers could not be separated by flash column chromatography. We noticed that Yamazaki et al. described the failure of the reaction of the trifluoropropynyllithium with imines due to the less active imine carbon, but the structures of imines were not given [32] . The successful reaction between trifluoropropynyllithium and glyceraldimine was attributed to prior formation of a five-membered chelate with the 2-alkoxy group [21\u201325] , which lowers the transition state energy and thus increase the reaction rate [21\u201325] . Probably, this intermolecular chelation also stabilized the lithium reagent. With the propargylic amine 4 in hand, both enantiomers of trifluoronorvaline were synthesized in a straightforward fashion ( Scheme 3 ). Reduction of the triple bond and removal of the benzyl group of compound 4 by hydrogenation in the presence of 5% Pd/C and protection of the resultant amino group with Boc 2 O were accomplished in a one-pot process to give the compounds 5a and 5b in 94% yield ( 5a / 5b = 1:1.5). Compounds 5a and 5b were easily separated by flash column chromatography. Treatment of 5a with TsOH/MeOH afforded the diol 6a in 87% yield. Finally, oxidation of the dihydroxyl moiety with RuCl 3 /NaIO 4 successfully provided the desired Boc-protected ( R )-5,5,5-trifluoronorvaline 7a in 76% yield. In addition, Boc-protected ( S )-5,5,5-trifluorovaline 7b was also obtained in 67% yield over two steps from 5b using the same procedure. Treatment of 7b with trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature gave free amino acid ( S )-5,5,5-trifluoronorvaline 8 in quantitative yield. The optical rotation of 8 ([\u03b1] D 20 = +8.0 (c 0.35, H 2 O)) is in accordance with its reported value ([\u03b1] D 20 = +7.2 (c 1.5, H 2 O)) [20] . Therefore, the absolute configuration of Boc-protected ( S )-5,5,5-trifluorovaline 7b was confirmed. In conclusion, we found that the nucleophilic addition of 3,3,3-trifluoropropynyllithium to d -glyceraldimine gave the corresponding trifluoromethylated propargylic amine 4 in moderate yield (55%). Starting from the compound 4 , a concise synthetic approach to both enantiomers of 5,5,5-trifluoronorvaline was developed. 3 Experimental 3.1 General All reagents were used as received from commercial sources, unless specified otherwise, or prepared as described in the literature.
